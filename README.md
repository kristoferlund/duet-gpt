2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

3. Set up a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPEN_AI_KEY=your_openai_key
```

4. Run DuetGPT using yarn:

```bash
yarn start

## `boot.prompt`

The [`boot.prompt`](boot.prompt) file contains the instructions that govern the interaction between the AI and the developer. It sets the ground rules for how the conversation is conducted and what each party is expected to do.

The developer presents tasks to the AI, who then provides ResponseMessages that include either a BashCommand, a PatchCommand or a follow-up Question for clarification. The developer follows the commands given by the AI to perform the requested tasks.
