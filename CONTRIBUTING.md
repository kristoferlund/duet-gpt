# Contributing to DuetGPT!

Kid: 🎵Hey Robot, let's talk about how we contribute!🎵

Robot: 🎵Indeed, young one. First, please fork and clone the repository before you start making changes.🎵

Kid: 🎵Okay, I got it. And when we've made our changes, we make a commit and then a pull request, right?🎵

Robot: 🎵Correct. Be sure to write clear and concise commit messages, describing the changes you've made.🎵

Kid: 🎵Before sending a pull request, we should update our fork with the latest changes from the main repo, huh?🎵

Robot: 🎵Affirmative. Always rebase when possible to keep the commit history clean and avoid merge conflicts.🎵

Kid: 🎵We should also be nice to each other and respect the Code of Conduct when we interact, right?🎵

Robot: 🎵Absolutely. Mutual respect and collaboration are the foundations of a great open-source community.🎵

Kid & Robot: 🎵Let's work together and make this project even better!🎵
